/**
 * Cross-origin isolation for the editor, from a service worker.
 *
 * ffmpeg.wasm's multi-threaded core runs on SharedArrayBuffer, which a page only
 * gets when it is crossOriginIsolated - and that needs two response headers the
 * host cannot send (the site is static; the CSP already ships as a meta tag for
 * the same reason). A service worker sits between the page and the cache, so it
 * can add them to its own origin's responses.
 *
 * Scoped to /app/ on purpose: the landing pages have nothing to gain from
 * isolation, and COEP would make any cross-origin embed they later grow fail.
 *
 * Isolation is decided when the document is created, so the very first visit is
 * never isolated - this worker only takes effect from the next navigation. That
 * is why registration is silent and never forces a reload: a transcode started
 * today runs single-threaded, and the tab the user opens tomorrow does not.

/**
 * Documents and worker scripts, and nothing else.
 *
 * Documents for the obvious reason. Worker scripts because a dedicated worker
 * owned by a require-corp document is REFUSED unless its own response carries
 * the same policy: an absent header means "unsafe-none", which is incompatible,
 * and the worker fails to start with an ErrorEvent carrying no message. That is
 * how this was found - the page was isolated, so the runtime picked the
 * multi-threaded core, and the core then sat for ever inside a worker that had
 * never come up.
 *
 * Everything else is left alone, not even re-fetched. Under require-corp a
 * same-origin subresource is already allowed without CORP, and every file this
 * app loads is same-origin - so proxying them buys nothing and costs plenty:
 * it pipes each response through `new Response(response.body, ...)`, and the
 * ffmpeg core is a 32 MB stream to hold open across a worker the browser may
 * decide to kill mid-flight.
