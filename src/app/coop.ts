/**
 * Register the service worker that makes the editor crossOriginIsolated.
 *
 * See `public/coop-sw.js` for what it does and why it has to be a worker. What
 * matters here is when: registration is fire-and-forget and never reloads the
 * page. Isolation is a property of the document, fixed when it was created, so
 * it cannot be granted to the tab that installs the worker - only to the next
 * one. Forcing a reload to close that gap would throw away whatever the user was
 * doing for a speedup they have not asked for yet.
 *
 * The cost of getting it wrong is nil: without isolation the ffmpeg runtime
 * loads the single-threaded core, which is what shipped before this existed.
